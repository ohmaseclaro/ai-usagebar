# ai-usagebar

Native Omarchy Quattro panel, Waybar widget, and tabbed TUI for AI plan usage across **Claude**, **Codex/ChatGPT**, **Z.AI (GLM)**, **OpenRouter**, **DeepSeek**, **Kimi**, and other supported AI coding services.

ai-usagebar began as a Rust port of
[`claudebar`](https://github.com/mryll/claudebar) and remains drop-in
compatible. It keeps claudebar's Pango tooltip, Omarchy theme detection, and
flock-protected OAuth refresh while adding more providers and a testable Rust
codebase.

## Features

- Per-provider Waybar modules use the same JSON shape and flags as claudebar.
- The native Omarchy Quattro plugin follows the shell theme and supports
  keyboard navigation, provider switching, live reset timers, and stale/error
  states.
- `ai-usagebar-tui` opens with a compact provider overview and refreshes every
  60 seconds. Its navigation can use a sidebar, navbar, or no vendor box.
- An optional Claude Code context view reads recent local session usage without
  scanning entire histories.
- Native integrations are available for Omarchy, GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma 6, and
  the macOS menu bar.
- One bar item can cycle through enabled providers. `[ui] primary` controls the
  initial provider in both the widget and TUI.
- Atomic caches and file locking prevent duplicate requests from multi-monitor
  Waybar setups.
- Network failures keep the previous data visible; HTTP errors appear in the
  tooltip.
- `--pretty`, `--watch N`, and `make smoke` help with local testing and API
  response changes.

## Install

### Omarchy Quattro

The native plugin is a display frontend and does not bundle the
`ai-usagebar` executable. Install the binary first, then add and enable the
plugin:

```bash
omarchy pkg aur add ai-usagebar-bin
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-usagebar.git --enable
```

Quattro enables its own `omarchy.agents` status widget by default. Disable it
if you want AI Usage to be the only agent status item in the bar:

```bash
omarchy plugin disable omarchy.agents
```

Once enabled, **left-click the AI Usage widget** to open the native Quattro
usage panel. From that panel, click the **gear** or press `s` to open the native
QML settings page. **Right-click intentionally opens `ai-usagebar-tui` in a
terminal**; it is not the settings shortcut. Middle-click or use the mouse
wheel to switch providers.

The source-built `ai-usagebar` AUR package can replace `ai-usagebar-bin` in
the first command.

### Arch (AUR)

Two packages. Pick one:

```bash
yay -S ai-usagebar-bin    # prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases (fast, ~5s install)
yay -S ai-usagebar        # compiles from source (~30-60s, hermetic)
```

The `-bin` variant downloads the same x86_64 ELF that CI built and tested. The source variant compiles locally with your toolchain. Both install identical binaries to `/usr/bin/`. If you already have one installed, switch with `yay -S` the other package; pacman handles the swap through `conflicts`/`provides`.

### Other Linux / macOS (crates.io)

```bash
cargo install ai-usagebar                # compile from source (needs rustup)
cargo binstall ai-usagebar               # download prebuilt binary (needs cargo-binstall, no rustup)
```

`cargo binstall` fetches the same x86_64 / aarch64 Linux tarball the AUR `-bin` package uses. Both install `ai-usagebar` + `ai-usagebar-tui` to `~/.cargo/bin/`.

### From source

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo make install                  # → /usr/local/bin
# or
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local   # → ~/.local/bin
```

### Windows

The **Waybar widget is Wayland-only and does not apply to Windows.** The
**`ai-usagebar-tui`** binary, however, runs natively, and `ai-usagebar --json`
/ `--pretty` work too (handy for feeding a custom tray/widget). Build with a
standard Rust toolchain:

```powershell
cargo build --release
# binaries land in target\release\ai-usagebar.exe and ai-usagebar-tui.exe
```

Credentials are read from the Windows user profile rather than `$HOME`:
`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (Anthropic) and
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` (OpenAI Codex). Run the official `claude` /
`codex` CLI once on Windows to populate them, exactly as on Linux/macOS.
API-key vendors work unchanged via environment variables or `config.toml`.

## Authentication

Claude and Codex reuse OAuth credentials from their official CLIs. Other
providers use API keys, an existing app login, or a local service. API keys can
come from environment variables or `config.toml`.

| Vendor | Method | Action required |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | OAuth from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or the macOS login Keychain | Run `claude` once. Tokens refresh automatically. |
| Anthropic API | Organization Admin key | Opt in with `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY` or `[anthropic_api] api_key`. Inference and Claude Code keys do not work. |
| Codex | OAuth, read from `~/.codex/auth.json` | Run `codex login` once. Token auto-refreshes. |
| Z.AI | API key (`ZAI_API_KEY` env or `[zai] api_key` in config) | Set either. |
| OpenRouter | API key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env or `[openrouter] api_key` in config) | Set either. |
| DeepSeek | API key (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or config) | Set either and opt in. |
| Kimi | API key (`KIMI_API_KEY` or config) | Set either and opt in. |
| Kilo | API key (`KILO_API_KEY` env or `[kilo] api_key` in config) | Set either. Opt-in. For a team balance, also set `[kilo] organization_id`; omit it for the personal balance. |
| Novita | API key (`NOVITA_API_KEY` env or `[novita] api_key` in config) | Set either. Opt-in. |
| Moonshot | API key (`MOONSHOT_API_KEY` or config) | Opt in. Set region `cn` for CNY; `global` uses USD. |
| Grok (xAI) | Management key | Opt in with `XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY` or config. An inference key does not work. |
| SuperGrok | Official Grok Build ACP extension | Opt in, install Grok Build, and run `grok login`. This reports subscription usage, not the Management API balance. |
| MiniMax | Token Plan subscription key | Opt in with `MINIMAX_API_KEY` or config. Choose the matching global or China region; pay-as-you-go keys do not work. |
| Google Antigravity | Local Antigravity server | Opt in and keep Antigravity or an interactive `agy` session running. |
| Cursor | Existing Cursor IDE or `cursor-agent` login | Opt in and sign in once. `cursor-agent` is the headless fallback. |
| Kiro CLI | Existing kiro-cli login | Opt in and run `kiro-cli login` once. ai-usagebar refreshes the session when needed. |

#### Grok: team-scoped vs organization-scoped keys

The balance lives at `/v1/billing/teams/{team}/prepaid/balance`, so a team has to
be identified. With a **team-scoped** management key the team is read
automatically from the key. An **organization-scoped** key cannot provide it
because that key's `scopeId` is an organization id rather than a team. Set the
team explicitly in that case:

```toml
[grok]
team_id = "your-team-id"
```

Without it, an organization-scoped key reports an error saying exactly this
rather than silently querying the wrong URL.

### Enabling a vendor

`enabled = true` is what makes a vendor fetch. Anthropic API, DeepSeek, Kimi,
Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, Grok, SuperGrok, Antigravity, Cursor, MiniMax, and Kiro CLI all default to **disabled** so that existing
installs are unaffected until you opt in. Use either method:

- Use the gear or `s` in the Omarchy panel, or run
  `ai-usagebar-tui` and press `s`. Saving a non-empty API key sets that vendor's
  `enabled = true` for you. Clearing it removes the inline key from
  `config.toml`.
- Add `enabled = true` to the vendor's config section alongside the key.

The primary-vendor selector only offers vendors that are currently enabled, so a
vendor you haven't opted into cannot be set as primary.

### Credential resolution order (for API-key vendors)

For each API-key vendor, ai-usagebar checks in this order:

1. A non-empty environment variable named by `api_key_env`.
2. An inline `api_key` in the same config section.
3. An error that names both missing options.

### Security

- Inline keys belong in `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml` at mode `600`.
  Redact them before committing that file to dotfiles. Environment variables
  remain the default and avoid storing keys in the config.
- Claude and Codex credentials stay in files managed by their official CLIs.
- SuperGrok credentials stay inside Grok Build. ai-usagebar receives a
  credential-free billing result and hashes auth/config files only to separate
  caches between logins.
- Cursor's `state.vscdb` and `cursor-agent` fallback `auth.json` are read-only.
- kiro-cli's `data.sqlite3` is read-only. Refreshed credentials go to an
  account-scoped `kiro/oauth.json` file, mode `600` on Unix.

#### macOS: Claude credentials in the Keychain

Recent Claude Code builds store OAuth credentials in the macOS login Keychain
instead of `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. No setup is needed: ai-usagebar uses
macOS's `security` tool to read and refresh the `Claude Code-credentials` item.

- The default account still uses an existing credentials file when one is
  present.
- Each scoped `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` login gets its own
  `Claude Code-credentials-<hash>` Keychain item.
- Named accounts use the scoped Keychain item on macOS and fall back to their
  credentials file on Linux.

## Configuration

The optional config file is `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml`. Claude,
Codex, Z.AI, and OpenRouter are enabled by default; other providers are
opt-in.

A minimal example:

```toml
[ui]
primary = "openai"

[kimi]
enabled = true
# api_key = "..."  # or set KIMI_API_KEY
```

See the [configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) for every provider,
display option, account path, region, and API-key setting.

## Quick start

```bash
# Local testing — auto-detects TTY and renders human-readable output.
ai-usagebar                        # uses [ui] primary (defaults to anthropic)
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic_api
ai-usagebar --vendor openai
ai-usagebar --vendor zai
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter
ai-usagebar --vendor deepseek
ai-usagebar --vendor kimi
ai-usagebar --vendor kiro

# Force Waybar JSON (e.g. piping into jq).
ai-usagebar --json

# Everything at once: quota + time-to-reset for every configured vendor,
# with one entry per named Claude account.
ai-usagebar usage
ai-usagebar usage --json | jq '.entries[] | {id, metrics, sections}'

# Live preview while iterating on --format / --tooltip-format.
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --watch 5

# Interactive TUI with tabs.
ai-usagebar-tui
```

The JSON report has two views of each provider:

- `metrics` contains percentage gauges only.
- `sections` preserves the complete ordered display, including balances,
  grouped rows, and spacers. Rows without a percentage do not invent one.

The report also includes the configured `primary` id. Each entry has
`display_name`, `status`, `stale`, and `fetched_at`; metric rows may add
`severity` and an absolute `reset_at`. These fields are additive, so existing
consumers remain compatible.

## Standalone TUI

The TUI does not depend on Waybar. Run it directly in a local terminal, over
SSH, or in a tmux pane:

```bash
ai-usagebar-tui                    # opens in your current terminal
```

It works in Kitty, Alacritty, Foot, Ghostty, and other terminal emulators. The
controls and Settings overlay are the same everywhere; no compositor or window
manager integration is required.

## Native desktop integrations

### Omarchy Quattro

Omarchy 4's Quattro shell can host ai-usagebar as a native Quickshell plugin.
Follow the two-step [Omarchy installation](#omarchy-quattro) above; adding the
plugin alone does not install its binary dependency.

Update or remove the plugin without editing `shell.json` by hand:

```bash
omarchy plugin update akitaonrails.ai-usagebar
omarchy plugin remove akitaonrails.ai-usagebar
```

The widget reads the providers and accounts already enabled in
`~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml`; it does not keep another copy of API keys.

- Left-click opens the native panel.
- The gear or `s` opens QML settings.
- Right-click launches the TUI.
- Middle-click or the mouse wheel switches providers.

The [Omarchy plugin guide](omarchy/README.md) covers keyboard controls,
credential handling, updates, and development checks.

The plugin depends only on the `ai-usagebar` executable. It runs the fixed
`ai-usagebar usage --json` command for reports and starts `ai-usagebar-tui`
only after a right-click. It installs no service, asks for no elevated
privileges, and does not overwrite user configuration.

### GNOME, KDE and macOS

| Integration | Supported providers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [macOS menu bar](macos/README.md) | Claude, Codex, Z.AI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, Grok (xAI), Anthropic API, Cursor, Google Antigravity | Thirteen providers. |
| [GNOME Shell](gnome-extension/README.md) | Claude, Codex, Z.AI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Google Antigravity | Antigravity's two quota pools appear as grouped rows. |
| [KDE Plasma 6](kde-plasmoid/README.md) | Whatever `usage --json` reports | Provider tabs in the popup; vendor is per applet instance. |

Cursor is not available in the GNOME extension yet. On GNOME, use
`ai-usagebar --vendor cursor` or open the TUI.

## Community integrations

External projects built on `ai-usagebar usage --json`. They live in their own
repositories and are maintained by their authors, not here.

- [cosmic-applet-ai-usage](https://github.com/jacksonsieben/cosmic-applet-ai-usage)
  — panel applet for the COSMIC desktop.

- [AI Usage for Noctalia](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/community-plugins/tree/main/ai-usagebar)
  — bar widget and panel for the Noctalia v5 shell, installable from its
  plugin browser as `felipeartur/ai-usagebar`.

## Waybar config

### Single module, scroll-to-cycle (recommended)

Use one bar item and scroll through your vendors. The TUI on-click still shows them all:

```jsonc
"modules-right": ["custom/aibar", ...],

"custom/aibar": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --format '{vendor_short} {session_pct}% · {session_reset}'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "signal": 13,
    "tooltip": true,
    "on-click": "ai-usagebar-tui",
    "on-scroll-up":   "ai-usagebar --cycle-next",
    "on-scroll-down": "ai-usagebar --cycle-prev"
}
```

`{vendor_short}` identifies the active provider with a three-letter code. For a
format shared by every cycled provider, use `{session_pct}`,
`{session_reset}`, `{weekly_pct}`, and `{weekly_reset}`. Cursor maps its two
usage pools to the session and weekly slots; Kiro maps its single pool to both.
The [placeholder reference](docs/format-placeholders.md) lists every generic
and provider-specific field.

`signal: 13` lets the scroll commands refresh the bar through `SIGRTMIN+13`
instead of waiting for the next interval.

The [KDE plasmoid](kde-plasmoid/README.md) has the same gesture in its own
settings and never reads or writes the state file this section relies on.

If a tray expander follows `custom/aibar`, the usage text may sit too close to
its icon. Add right padding in Waybar CSS:

```css
#custom-aibar {
    padding-right: 18px;
}
```

### Per-vendor modules

If you'd rather see them all at once:

```jsonc
"modules-right": ["custom/claude", "custom/openai", "custom/openrouter", "custom/zai", "custom/deepseek", "custom/kimi"],

"custom/claude": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --icon '󰚩'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true,
    "on-click": "ai-usagebar-tui"
},
"custom/openai": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor openai --icon '󱢆'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/openrouter": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --icon '󱙺' --format '{or_balance} · {or_used_today}'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 600,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/zai": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor zai --icon '󰚩'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/deepseek": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor deepseek --icon '󰧑'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 600,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/kimi": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor kimi --icon '󰚩'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 600,
    "tooltip": true
}
```

> Why 300s? The Anthropic and OpenAI Codex endpoints are undocumented and rate-limit aggressively below ~300s. The cache TTL is 60s so multi-monitor instances coexist, but Waybar's polling interval should stay at 300s.

### Multiple Claude accounts

Named accounts appear as separate TUI tabs and report entries. The recommended
setup is:

```bash
ai-usagebar account add work
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --account work
```

On macOS, the same account command can also capture and switch the active
Claude Desktop or CLI login. The dedicated
[Claude account guide](docs/claude-accounts.md) covers:

- explicit and auto-discovered accounts;
- safe credential and cache isolation;
- Waybar modules for personal and work subscriptions;
- macOS Desktop and CLI switching, backups, and history conflicts.

## Hyprland: float the TUI window

By default Hyprland tiles the TUI. To make `ai-usagebar-tui` open as a centered floating window, the same way Omarchy floats its own settings TUIs (Wi-Fi/`impala`, audio/`wiremix`, Bluetooth/`bluetui`), add this to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` or any sourced `.conf`, such as `looknfeel.conf`:

```ini
# ai-usagebar TUI — float + center + fixed size. omarchy-launch-tui sets the
# app-id from the binary basename, so the class is org.omarchy.ai-usagebar-tui.
# 875x600 matches the size Omarchy gives its own `floating-window`-tagged TUIs.
windowrule = float on, match:class ^(org\.omarchy\.ai-usagebar-tui)$
windowrule = center on, match:class ^(org\.omarchy\.ai-usagebar-tui)$
windowrule = size 875 600, match:class ^(org\.omarchy\.ai-usagebar-tui)$
```

Then `hyprctl reload` (no logout needed).

> Omarchy tags a hardcoded list of TUI app-ids with `floating-window` in `~/.local/share/omarchy/default/hypr/apps/system.conf`, which then applies `float + center + size 875 600`. The rules above set those values directly, so the size is deterministic regardless of which config is sourced first. If you launch the TUI differently (e.g. `kitty -e ai-usagebar-tui`), replace the class regex with whatever `hyprctl clients` reports for your terminal.

> Hyprland 0.46+ uses the unified `windowrule` keyword with `match:…` filters.
> The older `windowrulev2 = …, class:…` syntax still works on legacy releases
> but is deprecated. Use the form above on current Omarchy and Hyprland.

## Provider coverage

The CLI and TUI support every provider in the authentication table above.
Native desktop coverage varies by integration. The
[provider endpoint reference](docs/vendor-endpoints.md) lists each endpoint,
reported metric, desktop selector, stability note, and live-test command.

Run `make smoke` to check live response shapes.

## Format placeholders

Use placeholders in `--format` and `--tooltip-format`:

```bash
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --format '{session_pct}% · {session_reset}'
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --format '${or_balance} remaining'
```

Shared claudebar placeholders and every provider-specific field are listed in
the [format placeholder reference](docs/format-placeholders.md).

## Local development

```bash
ai-usagebar --watch 5                              # iterate on --format live
ai-usagebar --vendor openrouter --format '{or_balance} · today {or_used_today}'

make test                                          # unit + integration
source ~/.config/zsh/secrets                       # required for existing vendor smoke tests
make smoke                                         # runs all ignored tests; only Kimi skips without its key
make clippy                                        # cargo clippy -D warnings
```

## TUI controls

![ai-usagebar-tui showing the Codex tab — 5h and weekly gauges, Credits block with message-count ranges, tabs at top, key hints in the footer](screenshots/tui-openai.png)

- `Tab` / `l` / `→` — next tab
- `Shift+Tab` / `h` / `←` — previous tab
- `r` — refresh active tab
- `R` — refresh all tabs
- `s` — open Settings overlay (primary vendor + API keys)
- `c` — open local Claude context sessions (only when `[context] enabled = true`); `v` cycles its layout
- `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` — quit

The TUI refreshes every 60 seconds. During a refresh it keeps the current values
visible with a `↻` marker. If the request fails, the last snapshot remains on
screen and is marked stale.

OpenRouter uses the same layout for balance, usage by period, and account tier:

![ai-usagebar-tui showing the OpenRouter tab — Credit balance gauge at 98% in red ($13.67 left of $900), Usage by period with today/week/month, paid tier](screenshots/tui-openrouter.png)

### Local context overlay

The optional context overlay answers a different local question from the
vendor tabs: how much input context was present in recent Claude Code sessions.
Enable it by hand, restart the TUI, and press `c`:

```toml
[context]
enabled = true
layout = "full"                          # full | split | bottom  (`v` cycles)
# projects_path = "~/.claude/projects"  # this is the default
# context_window_tokens = 200000         # optional fallback

# Exact model ids override the fallback when 200K and 1M sessions coexist.
[context.model_context_window_tokens]
"claude-opus-4-6" = 1000000
```

The default `full` layout replaces the dashboard body. Press `v` to cycle
through `full`, `split`, and `bottom` layouts.

- `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` selects a session.
- `Enter` opens its detail gauge.
- `Esc` returns and `r` rescans.

The percentage follows
[Claude Code's status-line definition](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline):
`input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens`. Without
a trustworthy model window size, the overlay shows tokens instead of guessing
a percentage. After compaction, it waits for the next assistant response before
calculating a new value.

The reader handles Claude Code's undocumented local JSONL defensively:

- it reads bounded tails from the 100 most recently modified top-level
  sessions;
- it ignores corrupt records and `subagents` sidechains;
- it does not follow discovered symlinks;
- it performs filesystem work off the UI thread.

When the feature is disabled, nothing under `~/.claude/projects` is read.
Context options remain in TOML rather than the Settings modal.

### Settings overlay

![Settings overlay floating over the TUI — Primary vendor radio (Claude selected), masked Z.AI API key (•••), masked OpenRouter API key (•••), Save button, key hints at bottom. This older screenshot predates later API-key providers described below.](screenshots/tui-settings.png)

Press `s` while the TUI is open. The overlay lets you:

- Pick the **primary vendor** that the widget defaults to and that the TUI selects on startup. Use `←` / `→` to cycle.
- Enter a key for any supported API-key provider. Keys are masked as you type;
  press `Ctrl-V` to reveal or hide them. The provider's configured environment
  variable still wins at runtime; the inline key is the fallback. Saving a
  non-empty key also sets that provider's `enabled = true`.

Key bindings inside the overlay:

- `Tab` / `↑↓` — move between fields
- `←` / `→` — cycle primary-vendor selection (only on the vendor field)
- `Ctrl-V` — toggle key visibility on the focused key field
- `Ctrl-S` — save and close
- `Esc` — discard and close

Save updates `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml` through `toml_edit`, preserving
comments and unrelated settings. The file is set to mode `600`.

Omarchy's native QML form uses the same Rust persistence path and semantics.
It never loads stored key values into the long-lived shell process: blank means
unchanged, clear is explicit, and new values are sent to the binary over stdin.

After saving:

- TUI tabs fetch again immediately.
- Waybar modules configured with `signal: 13` refresh through `SIGRTMIN+13`.
- Other Waybar modules refresh on their next interval. Run
  `pkill -SIGUSR2 waybar` to force a full reload.

## Theming

- One Dark palette by default.
- Auto-merges with the active Omarchy theme at `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml`.
- Per-color overrides: `--color-low`, `--color-mid`, `--color-high`, `--color-critical` (claudebar-compatible).
